        <br><br>
        <p>This is the fascinating story of the Rummikub game, whose conception is obscured in the past, over 70 years ago. </p>
        <p>Mr. Ephraim Hertzano originally made his living selling toothbrushes and other plastic accessories as well as cosmetics. The game started as a brilliant idea that had occurred to Mr. Hertzano, living in Romania, when card-playing was outlawed under the Communist regime. Mr. Hertzano envisioned playing a game that would use small tiles instead of cards to play, a game that could be played by young and old alike, and that had no ties to any language or religion. He wanted to create a game that would bring people together and one day change the world’s leisure time. He called it Rummikub. Accompanied with a vision just as bright and as grand as the initial idea, it became an overnight hit.</p>    
        <p>The Hertzano family moved to Israel in the 1940’s after World War II, continuing the development on Rummikub in the backyard of his house in Bat Yam, and eventually became a professional game developer after publishing it to the market</p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p> Each tile is worth its face value (the number shown on the tile). In order to make an initial meld, each player must place tiles on the table in one or more sets that total at least 30 points. These points must come from the tiles on each player’s rack; for their initial meld, players may not use tiles already played on the table. A joker used in the initial meld scores the value of the tile it represents. When players cannot play any tiles from their racks, or purposely choose not to, they must draw a tile from the pool. After they draw, their turn is over. Play passes to the left (clockwise). On turns after a player has made his/her initial meld, that player can build onto other sets on the table with tiles from his/her rack. On any turn that a player cannot add onto another set or play a set from his/her rack, that player picks a tile from the pool and his/her turn ends. Players cannot lay down a tile they just drew; they must wait until their next turn to play this tile. Play continues until one player empties his/her rack and calls, “Rummikub!” This ends the game and players tally their points (see Scoring). If there are no more tiles in the pool but no player has emptied his/her rack, play continues until no more plays can be made. This ends the game.</p>
    
    
    
    <h3> Manipulation </h3>

    <p> Manipulation is the most exciting part of playing "Rummikub®". Players try to table the greatest amount of tiles by rearranging or adding to sets which are already on the table. Sets can be manipulated in many ways (examples follow) as long as at the end of each round only legitimate sets remain and no loose tiles are left over.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Add one or more tiles from rack to make new set</li>
        <li>Remove a fourth tile from a group and use it to form a new set</li>
        <li>Add a fourth tile to a set and remove one tile from it, to make another set</li>
        <li>Splitting a run</li>
        <li>Combined split</li>
        <li>Multiple split</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>The Joker</h3>

    <p>There are two jokers in the game. Each joker can be used as any tile in a set, and its number and color are that of the tile needed to complete the set. On future turns, a joker can be retrieved from a set on the table by a player who can replace it during his/her turn with any tiles that can keep the set legitimate. This tile can come from the table or from a player’s rack. In the case of a group of three tiles, the joker can be replaced by a tile of either of the missing colors. When a player retrieves a joker, the joker will once again have any value or color. However, a player who retrieves a joker must play the joker on his/her current turn to make a new set, and must also use at least one tile from his/her rack on that turn (just as on any other turn). A player cannot retrieve a joker before s/he has played his/her initial meld</p> 


    <h3>Time Limit</h3>
    <p>There is a time limit of 1 minute per player, per turn. Players who go over the time limit must draw a tile from the pool, ending their turns. </p>


    <h3>Incomplete Runs</h3>
    <p>Players who cannot complete a move within the 1 minute time limit must replace the tiles that were on the table to their previous positions, take back the tiles they played, and draw 3 tiles from the pool as a penalty. This ends the turn. </p>

    <h3>Winning</h3>
    <p>When the last round ends, the player who has won the most games in all rounds combined is the winner. In the case of a tie, the player with the highest score is the winner. </p>

    <h3>Scoring</h3>
    <p>After a player has cleared his/her rack and called “Rummikub!”, the other players add up the value of the tiles they are holding on their racks as a negative figure and the winner of the game receives a positive score equal to the total of all the other players’ points. As an aid to checking the figures, the winner’s score should equal the total of the other players’ scores in each game and at end of each round. Note: the penalty for having a joker on a rack is 30 points. In the rare case that all the tiles in the pool are used before any player goes “Rummikub!” and no player can play any more tiles, the player with the lowest value of tiles on his/her rack wins the round. Each player totals up the value of his/her tiles and subtracts it from the winner’s total (this will result in a negative number for each player). They then reduce their scores by this amount. The total of these negative numbers is scored to the winner as a positive amount. After scoring the game, players place all the tiles back on the table and begin the next game by following the directions under Set Up. In addition to keeping track of points, players keep track of the number of games each player has won.</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>
    <img width="480px"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Rummikub_Tiles.jpg/1920px-Rummikub_Tiles.jpg">
    <p>The beginning of a game of Rummikub may seem slow, but as the table builds up, more plays are possible. In the early stages of the game it’s a good idea to hold back some tiles so that other players open up the table and provide more opportunities for play. Sometimes it is useful to hold back the fourth tile of a group or run and play only three, so that on the next turn you can play a tile instead of drawing from the pool. Keeping a joker on your rack is also a good strategy; however, you risk being caught with it (earning a penalty of 30 points) when another player goes “Rummikub!”</p>
